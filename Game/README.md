#Pokemon Game

##Purpose

This lab exists to get used to the conventions in C++ after a semester of programming in Java.  Most of the code here was written last year but has been edited for clarity and the removal of some odd conventions.

##Issues
1. Don't use the `break` keyword unncessarily-you're better off using a boolean flag of some sort.  
2. In your `main.cpp`, any helper method must be declared *above* the main method.  If you declare it below, you need to declare the function prototype ahead of main, otherwise main is not going to know how to use your program.
3. This lab will most likely not be revisited beyond compliance concerns-it has limited educational value beyond basic class familiarity in C++.
4. Any code that can be removed from branching statements should be.
