#Inheritance Lab

##Purpose

This lab utilizes inheritance more thoroughly than the stack lab, while using the stack interface and classes we built in the previous lab.  We also explore casting from a parent class to a child class, among other things.

##Core Concepts

1. Inheritance: This lab takes inheritance to a whole new level, with derived classes that are derived from derived classes. 

2. Protected members: You've used public and private members.  Protected members are similar but can be used by derived classes.

3. You can cast a pointer from a parent class to a pointer of a child class using `static_cast<type_you_want_to_cast_to*>(pointer to cast)`

##Issues

1. You'll have to explore how to use initializer lists with inheritance.
