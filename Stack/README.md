# Stack Lab

##Purpose
This lab is designed to familiarize the concept of a stack as well as inheritance, along with some more exception handling.

##Concepts
1. Interfaces:  While C++ doesn't have *interfaces* per se, it does allow for abstract classes (classes where some methods are virtual).  A class that consists of all pure virtual methods, except for the destructor, is therefore a *de facto* interface.  

2. Operator overloading: C++ allows operators (like <,>,+,etc.) to mean different things depending on the context.  This will be useful during this lab.

3. Inheritance: The idea that some classes can operate as specialized versions of other classes.

##Issues

Coming soon.
