# School
This repository is just school projects that I've completed or am adding extended functionality to.  These are largely trivial
projects in order to get acquainted with git.  Hopefully I'll be pushing bigger projects down the road.

Note:  All these projects have been submitted for grading.  I used Github for hosting these files so that I could easily transfer files between my personal machine and department linux machines (valgrind doesn't work with Macs).  Obviously, these are open and available to the public; I don't care what happens to them now.  But after a few README updates this repository will likely be deprecated.
